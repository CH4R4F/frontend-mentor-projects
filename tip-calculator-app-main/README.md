## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- pure CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Js (practicing)


### Continued development

I think I need to learn more about layouts, maybe learn grid systeme
***everything is flexbox***, that what I wanted to avoid during the process of this project but I think I failed.
I need to develope my DOM skill, actually I didn't learn it I just Use the help of Emmet on Vscode and trying to make some sense .
I have to learn a framwork or a library. maybe!
